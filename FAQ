Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

This isn't universal windows platform!
--------------------------------------

Go figure. If this confuses you too much, feel free to use Âµwp instead.

'login authentication failed'
-----------------------------

It goes without saying to check that:
	- You have configured the site properly
	- Your credentials are right
	- You are using an application password, not your human password
	- Your site is running WordPress
	- The admin dashboard and logins are enabled
	- The site is up

No output from tools
--------------------

uwp tools follow the UNIX ideal that "when a program has nothing interesting or
surprising to say, it says nothing at all". If you need to detect success, uwp
always returns a corresponding return code.

So, to detect a successful authentication:
	uwp test mysite && echo "success"
Conversely for a failure:
	uwp test mysite || echo "failed"

Misaligned output from tools
----------------------------

uwp does not align output for human consumption, as this makes use in shell
scripts and generally machine parsing annoying and inconvenient. As such,
output fields are always delimited by a single TAB character, regardless of
alignment, allowing fields to be exctracted with a simple 'cut -f'.

If you need alignment, pipe output to 'column -t':
	$ uwp sites | column -t
		NAME  URL                           USERNAME   PASSWORD
		ejm   https://ethanjmarshall.co.uk  EMarshall  pass:uwp
		ejm2  https://ethanjmarshall.co.uk  EMarshall  ask

Storing passwords in plain text is insecure
-------------------------------------------

Use pass(1) and put pass:<password-name> as the password.
