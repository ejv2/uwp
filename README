uwp - MicroWordPress
=====================

"uwp" or "Âµwp" is an intentionally small but powerful remote admin tool for
wordpress. It allows for the entire site to be run simply from your terminal
with a minimal interface which is designed to sit well with the rest of your
UNIX system.

uwp is minimal and is useful in both scripting, automation and simply working
on WordPress sites from the comfort of your own system.

Requirements
------------

uwp requires:
	- libcurl
	- libmd4c (with HTML support)
	- libbsd (Linux only)
	- a c99 compiler
	- a POSIX shell

for best experience:
	- gpg and password-store
	- a working internet connection
	- the environment variables $BROWSER, $PAGER and $EDITOR set
	- a computer better than a toaster

WordPress v5.6 or later is required.

Running
-------

uwp in of itself is simply a wrapper which can run other, more
specialised programs for specific tasks, but with certain global options.

Example:
	uwp help		--> executes /usr/bin/uwp-help
	uwp post "New Post"	--> executes /usr/bin/uwp-post "New Post"

This is loosely inspired by the architecture of git, with the difference that
you may run these "plumbing" programs directly, rather than through one binary.

Configuration
-------------

Much of the configuration of uwp is done through config.h, but sites can be
configured via the file ".config/uwp/sites" file, format of which is a simple
TSV file. Fields are documented separately.

Authentication
--------------

uwp passwords are WordPress application passwords. This is required to get
around WordPress's stupid (but aptly named) "nonce" system, designed to stop
scripts using its API. Instead, an application password must be used. You can
generate this at the bottom of your profile settings menu.

It should look like this:
	abcd EFGH 1234 ijkl MNOP 6789
